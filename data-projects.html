	When I spend an obscene amount of time per day browsing the infamous Reddit, I often fail([ed] since now I am woke thanks to this data section) to realize how my data is being used and what I am actually being tracked for. For most people who are constantly interacting with technology, they would also be in the same predicament as me, wondering and asking the same questions about how their data is being used. However, to keep in the scope of my personal project, the data I collected about my habits and preferences were from the online Multiplayer Online Battle Arena game called League of Legends. Over a two-week span starting from the 16th of September to the 29th of September, I collected the following data: role played, champion played, game length, kill-death-assist ratio, whether I lost or won each game, and the dates of each game. Interestingly enough, when I play the game normally without collecting the data in mind, my results are VERY widespread and random. However, I noticed that the games I was playing through the collection window were completely different from when I normally play. For example, I found that my highest win-rate role was with the Support role which compared to anything outside of the collection time was primarily in Attack Damage Carry and Jungle with a significantly lower win-rate. The main conclusion that I could make is that subconsciously these games during the collection time mattered more to me than just regular games which led me to play the role that I thought would win me the most games despite it being the role I play the least usually. To elaborate more on how I collected the data, League of Legends has a match history page that tracks your games for the last 2 months. I also used the third-party site OP.GG to gain a more detailed insight for the games I played, which was helpful for determining some higher level insights about my gameplay.

<br>
<br>

As for representing the data and crafting the visuals, I used a site called Piktochart to create the infographic. I thought for my specific data, it would be the best choice to represent it using an infographic format since most of my data was quantitative.
An alternative topic I would have chosen for data collection was tracking what subreddits on the app Reddit I use the most. Instinctively, I would guess my top three are r/news, r/Leagueoflegends, and a tie between r/streetwear and r/sneakers.

<br>
<br>

Finally, to reflect on what we learned in the course, I actually cannot stop analyzing everything I see based on the two schools of thought. I find myself deciphering every commercial and typically looking at things through the lens of the Birmingham School. It seems that a lot of these ads that are run are specifically catering to the average lower/middle class worker, constantly showcasing what it’s like to escape from the everyday things like work, dealing with family, going to the gym/exercising etc. (Specifically I’ve seen this a lot with alcohol ads where they cater heavily to rugged rural Americans or millenials) Personally, I feel like it’s slightly harder for me to analyze things from the Frankfurt school because I feel like in a way we are conditioned to just accept things as they are since we are constantly being shown “sheepish” types of media. Not to get political but for example, I think a majority of the United States population who follows what the Trump administration is doing have become numb to the insane amount of impeachable offenses he has been committing recently. Another example is with Jeffrey Epstein’s suicide. It was almost unbelievable to watch excuse after excuse arise from the investigation of his death to the point where it just made me expect that no real consequences came from the case. Applying that idea of just getting used to things happening without actually looking deeper into whether those things are good or bad is something that I have been actively trying to bolster my strength on.

<br>
<br>

In conclusion, this class so far has been really interesting and pretty much every day I share the stories and videos we watch with my friends since we talk at least once a day about current events. As far as how I’ve been protecting my data, I’ve been a lot more conscious in what apps (besides the usuals) I am using and how I am consenting to what they are wanting to collect from me. (I actually read a whole Terms of Service agreement although it was short) I’ve also been making sure to keep myself in the know about which corporations are in trouble and staying as far away as I can from them like Facebook for example. I got to work on a data project for my internship last summer and I learned how extremely important it is to have the right algorithms to extract and represent the data because even the most miniscule error can cause a massive amount of misrepresentation and miss key insights that can be inferred from the sets. Overall, I as well as many others would like to be reassured in the future that their data is safe and being collected in a fair and ethical way, as opposed to what we are currently experiencing right now.

      <strong>Section 1: Vision Statement:</strong> After interviewing students from Washington State University, we have come to the conclusion that a major issue regarding money to students is saving. Frequently when interviewing the students when asked aboutmoney, the students said things like “I don’t have enough money for major payments” and “I have missed out on major events because I didn’t have enough money to pay for the ticket”Also, in these interviews we figured out that students frequently use social media services to communicate with their friends what they are planning on doing or events that they are going to. But not without trouble, they say that they have to individually ask their friends on what they are doing or what events they are going to. In the Fjord article: “10 key trends for 2016”. He discusses that “In the past, highly tailored experiences were reservedfor the wealthy, with cost and scale being the main barrier to entry.” We thought this was a major problem as some apps that deal with big issues can only be used if you pay for them or have other ways of getting you to pay and lose money such as the app “Venmo” charges its users a percentage whenever a transfer is completed.So, we decided to incorporate these issues the average college students have and make an app that helps students with solving these problems. This app is free to use and helps students save up easily for events or large costs in the future. This app takes money out of the user’s bank account gradually leading up to the event
until the time that the user wants to buy a ticket object or any other item. The user can select whether or not theywant the money to be taken out daily, weekly, monthly, or any time increment the user wants. This will make it easy for the use it to get the money needed for the ticket or object that they are wanting to buy. The app makes money by putting out short ads about products that the user might want when the goal amount is reached. This app also has a relationship with a social media concept as it allows users to see events or items that their friends have bought or saved up for using this app

<br>
<br>

<strong>Section 2: Design Proposal:</strong> When we first designed the object we were purely thinking about ourselves. How we would use it, what we like best, and what looks the best to us. But by using the design thinking process we were able to not only make our opinions are valid, but sympathize with others and what they view as valid aspects to an app. In the two different stages of development, there were a lot of good and bad things we found. The biggest one being in our first attempt we forgot to sympathize with what others would like. After going back and using the interviews and the different tools through the article, we were able to revise our first attempt and actually show the users after what we came up with. One student said, “inverted coloring is more attractive in new apps”. For our final product we have a color change, a font change, and an alignment change. We went from green on black to black on green. We also made a design decision based on the interactions we had with the people we interviewed. Another student saids, “my biggest problem with my bank account app is it very loads”. Being able to make it easy to load in theory, being able to connect with their friends (like a social media app), and being able to see their balance in the app were our top priorities based on feedback. Another comment someone made was about how it looked a lot like the app “hulu” and we had no idea. After hearing all those different things, we were able to come up with the final product.It was constantly important to make it easy for people and creating something that appeals to them. So when making those modifications, that is what we kept in mind. In the reading the quote, “There are typically many stages of prototyping before determining your ultimate intervention.”  was really helpful in our process and made us truly focus on doing prototyping as part of our routine.

<br>
<br>

<strong>Section 3: Reflections on the Design Thinking Process:</strong> Our design and mission of our app was created to help the average person save money easier and with definitive goals in mind for ease of access. This idea prevailed over the others since it was something that could easily be created and visualized using a wire-frame. (shows the different screens of the app and what not) This idea also allowed us to craft interview questions that were very broad and easy for asking open-ended questions with our app, which allows you to gain valuable insight rather into a person’s decision making regarding our app, compared to just a simple yes or no answer.As for the actual design thinking process, one of our first collaboration sessions was on how we can best visualize our idea and display it to others. At first, we we were going to make an actual demonstrable iOS app, but decided against it since we could easily showcase the concept with simple static images.Our initial prototype for the app was a color palette with black and white as the primary colors, with a mint green as the secondary coloring. However, based on our interviews with students from WSU, we found that most of them preferred to coloring to be inverted, with mint green being the primary color and black and white as the secondary colorings. Finally, we recreated those screens with the feedback on other aspects of the app to create our final product which is shown above.For the last part of our design process, it came from our template and how we chose to write about our app. One of the first critiques from an external reviewer of our app, was that we did not have any quotes from the interviewees describing the reactions and questions to our app. After our second iteration thanks to key insights from Landon, we have improved our template descriptions by adding those quotes from our interview sessions. Overall, the design thinking process was well utilized by our team. One improvement we would try to tackle is get information from people who have actually made and shipped out iOS App Store-ready apps so that we can learn even more on how to display our mission and idea tousers of the app.

Initially, the group had a pretty good idea of what it was that we were going to create. We loved the examples that were given on slack, and we wanted to create something based upon that, but with a lot more detail. We focused a lot on making this, to start, a creative piece. We gathered a lot of images and just started putting things together. As we went on, we deiced we needed to get a little deeper and eventually trashed the idea that we had before, completely. We liked the images we found, but wanted to use them in a different light. Once we sat down together and talked about what it was that we were trying to get across and convey, we agreed upon a video. Being able to create a moving art piece, we thought, would be the most compelling for something simple we wanted to talk about. The materials we selected for the video were all through the public domain, pixels, and we used an editing app for the video creation. The cultural understanding through our art piece was the idea that our culture is OK going through life the way it is; not good nor bad but we found it fascinating. <br><br> Our culture does not have an interest for what is was, and that is the story were trying to tell.
Our explanation for the art piece is quite simple. When you get in the car to go somewhere, you tend to think about the destination and where you’re leaving from. Whether that means knowing how long it takes to get from A to B, or just wanting to get there. The way we took this art piece is the headphone technology works along the same way. There was a time where it started, where it went, and where it got to, and the road keeps going. As time goes on, so does Technology. Many of us are going through life with what we have now, not even understanding what it was before or what it could be. This art piece is to show that headphones were a journey, and still are.
